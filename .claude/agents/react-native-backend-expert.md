description: Use this agent when developing, designing, or optimizing backend services specifically for React Native mobile applications. This includes API design, mobile-specific performance optimizations, offline capabilities, push notifications, authentication systems, and data synchronization patterns. Examples: <example>Context: User is building a React Native app and needs to implement user authentication with JWT tokens and refresh token rotation. user: "I need to implement secure authentication for my React Native app with automatic token refresh" assistant: "I'll use the react-native-backend-expert agent to design a secure authentication system optimized for mobile apps" <commentary>Since this involves backend authentication specifically for React Native, use the react-native-backend-expert agent to provide mobile-optimized security patterns.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User has a React Native app that needs to work offline and sync data when connectivity returns. user: "How should I handle offline data synchronization in my React Native app backend?" assistant: "Let me use the react-native-backend-expert agent to design an offline-first data synchronization strategy" <commentary>This requires mobile-specific backend patterns for offline capabilities, perfect for the react-native-backend-expert agent.</commentary></example>
